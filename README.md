# Arduino_Charlieplex
A library for Arduino to control Charlieplexed LED matrices

Drive (N * (N-1)) number of "Charlieplxed" diode matrices
(e.g. LED Matrix) with N number of outputs capable of tri-state.

There are two main functions: 
1. turnOn: To turn a LED on for a given position.
2. turnOff: To turn a LED off for a given position.
